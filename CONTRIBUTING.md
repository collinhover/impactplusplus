## How to Contribute

We welcome your contributions - Thanks for helping make Impact++ a better project for everyone. If you find a bug or want to add a new feature please check the active and resolved issues list here on github, it may already be in the works. If you can't find it, no worries, we understand the project is reasonably large enough to make some things hard to find. Feel free to ask!

4. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
