# Contributing to Impact++

## How to Contribute

We welcome your contributions - Thanks for helping make Impact++ a better project for everyone. If you find a bug or want to add a new feature please check the active and resolved issues list here on github, it may already be in the works. If you can't find it, no worries, we understand the project is reasonably large enough to make some things hard to find. Feel free to ask!

## Overview

Please submit pull requests via feature branches using the semi-standard workflow of:

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
(when necessary). Create tests to verify bugs or features (use [Jasmine](https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine)).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request for the **dev branch**
