##Getting Started
####First Steps
1. Download using one of the "Download" links and extract the files.
2. Copy the **impactplusplus/lib/plusplus** folder into your new or existing ImpactJS project **lib** directory.
3. Either copy the **impactplusplus/lib/weltmeister/config.js** into your projet's **lib/weltmeister** directory...
4. Or, if you have a custom Weltmeister config:
	* add ```'lib/plusplus/entities/*.js'``` to the ```entityFiles``` setting
	* change the ```collisionTiles.path``` setting to ```'lib/weltmeister/collisiontiles_plusplus_64.png'```
5. Make sure you're comfortable with the [ImpactJS Documentation](http://impactjs.com/documentation)
6. Load up the Impact++ Jump N' Run demo (see below) to review the basics
7. Dive into the [Impact++ Documentation](http://collinhover.github.com/impactplusplus)

####Demo: Jump N' Run
Check out the Jump N' Run demo for an overview of getting started with Impact++, located in the 'examples/jumpnrun' directory. Don't forget to copy the ImpactJS engine and Weltmeister files into the demo directory!

####Demo: SUPER COLLIDER!
Check out the SUPER COLLIDER demo for an overview of how to use almost every single feature in Impact++, located in the 'examples/supercollider' directory. Don't forget to copy the ImpactJS engine and Weltmeister files into the demo directory!

##FAQ
####Ejecta, Cocoonjs, etc?
Impact++ has been built from day one to be portable / wrappable to iOS, Android, Win8, etc. Tests are ongoing, but the library does nothing that should need special handling when porting or wrapping your game code for distribution as a mobile app. Please let us know if you find any issues!

####Custom Settings
	// edit the user config file at 'plusplus/config-user.js'
	// then you can set values
	// for any of the properties that appear in ig.CONFIG
	// and they will automatically be merged
	// over the base settings
	ig.CONFIG_USER = {
		// for example, one thing you'll probably want to set right away
		// is your own logo (in base64) for the loader
		LOADER_LOGO_SRC_MAIN: 'data:image/png;base64,...'
	};

####Design Philosophy
* _Modularity_ - code should be reusable whenever possible
* _Parametrize_ - projects should be able to change settings without modifying the library
* _Be agnostic_ - do not rely on device or browser specific functionality
* _Consistency_ - the codebase should look like a cohesive whole
* _Document_ - the codebase should be reasonably documented
