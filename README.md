##Getting Started
####First Steps
1. Download using one of the "Download" links and extract the files.
2. Copy the **impactplusplus/lib/plusplus** folder into your new or existing ImpactJS project **lib** directory.
3. Either copy the **impactplusplus/lib/weltmeister/config.js** into your projet's **lib/weltmeister** directory...
4. Or, if you have a custom Weltmeister config:
	* add ```'lib/plusplus/entities/*.js'``` to the ```entityFiles``` setting
	* change the ```collisionTiles.path``` setting to ```'lib/weltmeister/collisiontiles_plusplus_64.png'```
5. Make sure you're comfortable with the [ImpactJS Documentation](http://impactjs.com/documentation)
6. Load up the Impact++ Jump N' Run demo (see below) to review the basics
7. Dive into the [Impact++ Documentation](http://collinhover.github.com/impactplusplus)
  
####Demo: Jump N' Run
Check out the Jump N' Run demo for an overview of getting started with Impact++, located in the 'examples/jumpnrun' directory. Don't forget to copy the ImpactJS engine and Weltmeister files into the demo directory!
  
####Demo: SUPER COLLIDER!
Check out the SUPER COLLIDER demo for an overview of how to use almost every single feature in Impact++, located in the 'examples/supercollider' directory. Don't forget to copy the ImpactJS engine and Weltmeister files into the demo directory!
  
##FAQ
####Ejecta, Cocoonjs, etc?
Impact++ has been built from day one to be portable / wrappable to iOS, Android, Win8, etc. Tests are ongoing, but the library does nothing that should need special handling when porting or wrapping your game code for distribution as a mobile app. Please let us know if you find any issues!
  
####Custom Settings
	// edit the user config file at 'plusplus/config-user.js'
	// then you can set values
	// for any of the properties that appear in ig.CONFIG
	// and they will automatically be merged
	// over the base settings
	ig.CONFIG_USER = {
		// for example, one thing you'll probably want to set right away
		// is your own logo (in base64) for the loader
		LOADER_LOGO_SRC_MAIN: 'data:image/png;base64,...'
	};
  
####Design Philosophy
* _Modularity_ - code should be reusable whenever possible
* _Parametrize_ - projects should be able to change settings without modifying the library
* _Be agnostic_ - do not rely on device or browser specific functionality
* _Consistency_ - the codebase should look like a cohesive whole
* _Document_ - the codebase should be reasonably documented

```
ig.CollisionMap
```    
* entities now each have their own collision map result property, `collisionMapResult`, to reduce garbage
* collision map result's `.collision.slope` is now guaranteed to be a boolean, instead of changing between boolean and object

```
ig.Camera
```

```
ig.TimerExtended
```    
* removed, timer pausing now handled by entity during `pause` method (override when you have your own timers to pause)
  
```
ig.EntityExtended
```    
* entities always update the current animation, even when off screen, so animation overrides always complete as expected
* changed first parameter of `animRelease` to `name` to allow for releasing only when override matches name

* added `frame` and `stop` options to `animOverride` method

* setting grounded is now handled differently internally for top down mode
* `last` is now always contains last position instead of current
* colliding with an entity that functions as a moving platform now works as expected in all cases
* removed `onPaused` and `onUnpaused` signals for better stability (was causing issues with entities that persisted between levels)
* removed `updateCleanup` method
* removed `checkStop` method
* `intersectWith` method now sets `intersecting` property, make sure to call parent when you override this method!
* all properties modified by collision checks should now be reset via the `cleanupCollision` method (called automatically before new collisions)
* added `flipWith` property to `moveTo` settings object, which controls whether following entity flips with the followed entity
* In addition to per entity scaling, entities now have `scaleMin` and `scaleMax` properties to clamp scaling
* Added `scaleToSystemScale` for entities that should scale themselves based on system scale on a ratio other than 1:1
  
```

* fixed incorrect examples in docs
* added `clearPath` method for better control of path clearing

* ig.PlayerManager now handles basic input to action for the player character

```
ig.PlayerManager
```    
* new abstracted way to control characters, allowing you to easily swap the character the player controls with input! 
* playerManager's `handleInput` covers move, jump, and climb by default, and attempts to call the managed entity's `handleInput` method

```
ig.Tutorial
```

* to properly loop, set `duration === -1` and optionally `respawnDelay`
* added `propertiesTarget` to check for truthy values of properties in spawn targets to complete tutorial
  
```
ig.EntityTrigger
```    
* added `getCanTrigger` method to find out if the trigger can be triggered
* added `autoComplete` to allow triggers to manually call complete (fixes confusing behavior where `complete` is called twice)

```
ig.Switch
```
